    "# The Milky Way Galaxy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Counting the Stars in the Sky\n",
    "Humans have peered into the heavens and contemplated its vastness.  Sometimes, we have proposed various models to explain its form.  In some civilizations, the stars were believed to be on a celestial sphere that rotated majestically above a fixed, central Earth (i.e., geocentrism of Ptolemy).  When Galileo made his first telescopic observations, we started down a long road that has dramatically expanded our view of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "it is possible to get at least a general idea about the nature of other galaxies by studying our own Galaxy, but this is very challenging.  We live in a disk of stars, dust, and gas that severely impacts our ability to \"see\" beyond our relative stellar neighborhood when we look along the plane of the disk.  The problem is most severe when looking toward the center of the Galaxy in the constellation Sagittarius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of what we know today about the formation and evolution of the Milky Way is encoded in the motions of the Galaxy's constituents, especially when combined with information about the variations in composition.  Unfortunately, measuring the motions of the stars and gas in the Galaxy is done from a moving observing platform (i.e., the Earth) that is undergoing another motion around the Sun, which is orbiting the Galactic center.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical Models\n",
    "From observations of a *dark* night sky, an almost continuous band of light appears to circle the Earth.  It is inclined by about $60^\\circ$ with respect to the celestial equator.  It was Galileo who first realized that this Milky Way is a vast collection of individual stars.  In the mid-1700s, Kant and Wright proposed that the Galaxy must be a stellar disk and our Solar System is merely one component within that disk.  In the 1780s, William Herschel produced a map of the Milky Way based crudely on counting the number of stars the he could observe in 683 regions of the sky.  In his analysis, Herschel assumed that\n",
    "\n",
    "- all stars have approximately the same *absolute* magnitude,\n",
    "- the number density of stars in space is roughly constant,\n",
    "- there is nothing between the stars to obscure them, and \n",
    "- he could see the *edges* of the stellar distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "From his data, Herschel concluded that the Sun had to be very near the center of the distribution and that the dimensions measured along the plane of the disk were some $5\\times$ greater than the disk's vertical thickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jacobus Kapteyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_Kapteyn) confirmed Herschel's model of the Galaxy, again using the technique of star counting.  Through the use of more quantitative methods, Kapteyn was able specify a distance scale for his model of the Galaxy.  The **Kapteyn universe** was a flattened spheroidal system with a steadily decreasing stellar density with increasing distance from the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the plane of the Galaxy and at a distance of some $800\\ \\rm pc$ from the center, the number density of stars had decreased from its central value by a factor of $2$.  On an axis passing through thecenter and perpendicular to the central plane, the number density decreased by $50\\%$ over a distance of only $150\\ \\rm pc$.  The number density diminished to $1\\%$ of its central value at distances of $8500\\ \\rm pc$ (in the plane) and $1700\\ \\rm pc$ (perpendicular to the plane).  Kapteyn concluded that the Sun was located $38\\ \\rm pc$ north of the Galactic midplane and $650\\ \\rm pc$ from the center, measured along the Galactic midplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow Kapteyn's logic for his nearly heliocentric model of the universe, recall the equation for the distance modulus:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "m-M &= 5\\log_{10}\\left( \\frac{d}{10\\ \\rm pc}\\right), \\\\\n",
    "d &= 10^{(m-M+5)/5}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a value for $M$ (e.g., if the spectral class and luminosity class are known) and measuring $m$ at a telescope, the distance modulus $m-M$ and the distance $d$ are readily obtained.  Given the known coordinates of the star on the celestial sphere, its 3D position relative to the Earth is determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In actuality, it is impractical to estimate the distance to each individual star in the way described above because the number of stars in any given region is so great.  Instead, a statistical approach is used that is based on counting the number of stars in specified region down to a predetermined limiting apparent magnitude.  From this counting procedure, the number density of stars at a given distance can be estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly before Kapteyn's model was published, Harlow Shapley estimated the distances to 93 globular clusters using [RR Lyrae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RR_Lyrae_variable) and [W Virginis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_Virginis) stars.  These stars are easily identified in the clusters through their periodic variations in luminosity, and it is a matter of using the period-luminosity relation (to get their absolute magnitudes) to estimate their distances from the Sun.  The distances to the variable stars correspond to the distances to the clusters in which they reside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapley recognized that the globular clusters are not distributed uniformly throughout space, but are found preferentially in a region of the sky that is centered in the constellation of Sagittarius, at $15\\ \\rm kpc$ from the Sun.  He estimated that the most distant clusters are more than $70 \\rm kpc$ form the Sun, over $55\\ \\rm kpc$ from the center.  As a result, Shapley believed that the diameter of the Galaxy was on the order of $100 \\rm kpc$, which is close to $10 \\times$ the diameter estimated by Kapteyn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we known that Kapteyn's universe was too small and the Sun was too near the center, and Shapley's Galactic model was too large.  Both models errored in part for the same reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the failure to include in their distance estimates the effects of interstellar extinction due to gas and dust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kapteyn's selected regions were largely within the Galactic disk where extinction effects are most severe; as a result, he was unable to see the most distant portions of the Milky Way (causing him to underestimate its size).  The problem is analogous to someone on Earth trying to see the surrounding land while standing in a dense fog with limited visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapely chose to study objects that are generally found well above (and below) the plane of the Milky Way, and are inherently bright, which makes them visible from great distances.  It is in directions perpendicular to the disk that interstellar extinction is least important, although it cannot be neglected entirely.  Errors in the calibration of the period-luminosity relation used by Shapely let to overestimates of the distances to the clusters.  The calibration errors were traced to the effects of interstellar extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kapteyn was aware of the errors that interstellar extinction could introduce but he was unable to find any quantitative evidence for the effect.  Other researchers at the time suspected that dust might be responsible for the dark bands running across the Milky Way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Further evidence for strong extinction could also be found in Shapely's own data.  No globular clusters were visible within a region between approximately $\\pm 10^\\circ$ of the Galactic plane called the **zone of avoidance**.  Shapely suggested that globular clusters were apparently absent in the zone of avoidance because strong gravitational tidal forces disrupted the objects in that region; this was a similar argument for the existence of the Asteroid Belt in the Solar System.  In reality, interstellar extinction is so severe within the zone of avoidance that the very bright clusters are simply undetectable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Effects of Interstellar Extinction\n",
    "To see how interstellar extinction directly affects the estimates of stellar distances, we find\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "d = 10^{(m_\\lambda - M_\\lambda - A_\\lambda + 5)/5} = d^\\prime 10^{-A_\\lambda/5},\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d^\\prime = 10^{(m_\\lambda - M_\\lambda + 5)/5}$ is the erroneous estimate of the distance when extinction is neglected, and $A_\\lambda$ is the amount of extinction in magnitudes.  The extinction coefficient and magnitudes ($M$ and $m$) are all a function of wavelength due to the wavelength dependent way that light is scattered (or blocked) by dust or absorbed by gas clouds.  Since $A_\\lambda \\geq 0$ in all cases (i.e., extinction can't make a star appear brighter), $d\\leq d^\\prime$; the true distance is always less than the apparent distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the disk of the Milky Way, the typical extinction rate in visible wavelengths is $1\\ \\rm mag/kpc$.  The value can vary dramatically if the line of sight includes distinct nebulae (e.g., molecular clouds).  Fortunately, it is often possible to estimate the amount of extinction by considering how dust affect the color of a star (i.e., interstellar reddening).\n",

    "Kapteyn's method of star counting was not based on directly determining $d$ for individual stars.  Rather, the number of stars visible in selected regions of the sky are counted over a specified apparent magnitude range.  Alternatively, all stars in the regions brighter than a chose limit of apparent magnitude can be counted.  These approaches are known as **differential** and **integrated star counts**, respectively.\n",

Shapley suspected that the Sun does not reside at the center of the disk, but is actually located roughly 1/3 of the way out from the middle.  From the Earth, the center of the disk lies in the constellation Sagittarius, corresponding to avery compact emission source known as Sgr $A^\\star$ (A-star) at the J2000 equatorial coordinates\n",

    "Mixing of the ISM may after a SN Ia event may not be complete.  In other words, a local region of the ISM may become iron-enriched after $10^9\\ \\rm yr$, while another region may not experience the same level of enrichment.  According to the age-metallicity relation, the iron-rich regin would subsequently produce stars that appear younger, when in fact both regions are the same age.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second measure of ISM enrichment (and age) is based on $[{\\rm O}/{\\rm H}]$.  Since core-collapse supernova appear after only $10^7\\ \\rm yr$ after the onset of star formation and they produce a higher abundance of oxygen to iron, $[{\\rm O}/{\\rm H}]$ may also be used to determine ages of Galactic components; some astronomers use $[{\\rm O}/{\\rm Fe}]$ for the same purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Age Estimates of the Thin and Thick Disks\n",
    "Typical values for the iron-hydrogen metallicity ratio are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  $-0.5 < [{\\rm Fe}/{\\rm H}] < +0.3$ for the thin disk,\n",
    "-  $-0.6 < [{\\rm Fe}/{\\rm H}] <-0.4$ for the thick disk,\n",
    "\n",
    "although some thick disk members may have metallicities at least as low as $[{\\rm Fe}/{\\rm H}] \\sim -1.6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to various age determinations, the stellar members of the thin disk are probably significantly younger than their thick-disk counterparts.  It appears that star formation began in the thin disk about $8\\ \\rm Gyr$ ago and is ongoing today.  This conclusion is supported by the observations of white-dwarf stars in the thin disk and theoretical estimates of their cooling times.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also evidence that star formation in the thin disk may not have been continuous over time, but actually come in bursts with intervening gaps of several billion years.  On the other hand, star formation in the thick disk appears to have predated the onset of star formation in the thin disk by $2-3\\ \\rm Gyr$.  It is generally believed that the episode of thick-disk star formation spanned the time interval between $10-11\\ \\rm Gyr$ ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mass-to-Light Ratios\n",
    "From star counts and orbital motions, te estimated stellar mass of the thin disk is roughly $6\\times 10^{10}\\ M_\\odot$ with another $0.5 \\times 10^{10}\\ M_\\odot$ of gas and dust.  The luminosity in the blue is $L_B = 1.8 \\times 10^{10}\\ L_\\odot$.  When the first of these parameters is divided by the second, the result is the **mass-to-light ratio**, which is $M/L_B \\approx 3 M_\\odot/L_\\odot$.  This quantity gives us information about the kinds of stars responsible for the generation of the light.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the main sequence, a star's luminosity depends on its mass (i.e., mass-luminosity relation), with\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{L}{L_\\odot} = \\left(\\frac{M}{M_\\odot} \\right)^\\alpha,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha \\simeq 4$ above about $0.5\\ M_\\odot$ and $\\alpha \\simeq 2.3$ for less massive stars.  Assuming that most of the disk stars are on the main-sequence, an \"average\" stellar mass can be estimated.  Substituting the observed mass-to-light ratio and solving for the mass, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\langle M \\rangle 3^{1/(1-\\alpha)}\\ M_\\odot. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that $\\alpha \\simeq 4$, we find that $\\langle M \\rangle \\simeq 0.7\\ M_\\odot$.  Apparently the total luminosity of the disk is dominated by stars somewhat less massive than the Sun.  This should not be surprising since the initial mass function (IMF) indicates that many more low-mass than high-mass stars are created out of the interstellar medium.  This is also consistent with M-dwarf stars being the most common class of stars in the Sun's vicinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $B$-band luminosity of the thick disk is $2\\times 10^8\\ \\rm L_\\odot$, or $1\\%$ of the thin disk's luminosity.  This explains why the thick disk is so difficult to detect.  The mass of the thick disk is probably about $2-4 \\times 10^9\\ M_\\odot$, or approximately $3\\%$ of the thin-disk mass."

    "## The Structure of the Milky Way Galaxy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spiral Structure\n",
    "Significant structure exists within the disk.  Neutral hydrogen clouds, relatively young objects (e.g., O and B stars), H II region, and galactic (open) clusters are used as tracers of Galactic structure.  From these tracers, a spiral structure emerges, which gives the disk the appearance of a pinwheel.  When other galaxies (with distinct disks) are observed in blue light, these galaxies often exhibit similarly beautiful spiral structure (e.g., the great spiral galaxy of Andromeda).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when the galaxies are viewed in red light, which is characteristic of older, low-mass stars, the spiral structure is less pronounced.  It appears that spirals are associated with ongoing star formation and that older stars have had ample time to drift out of the spiral pattern.  The Sun seems to be located close to (but not actually in) one of the spiral arm features known as the **Orion-Cygnus arm**, or the **Orion spur** since it is probably not a full spiral arm structure. Spiral arms get their names from the constellations in which they are observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interstellar gas and dust clouds are clearly evident, located near the midplane, and found preferentially in the spiral arms.  If it were possible to view our Galaxy from a exterior vantage point (outside the disk but along the plane), it would probably appear similar to NGC 891.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interstellar Gas and Dust\n",
    "Gas and dust clouds exist in the Milky way with a range of masses, temperatures, and densities.  From these clouds, new stars are ultimately formed.  Astronomers have mapped out the overall distribution of dust and gas within the Milky Way by measuring the effects of obscuration by (and emissivity of) dust, as well as the location of the 21-cm H I emission, and the $\\rm CO$ molecule as a tracer of $\\rm H_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular hydrogen $\\rm H_2$ and cool dust are found predominantly between $3-8\\ \\rm kpc$ and $3-7\\ \\rm kpc$ from the Galactic center, respectively (i.e., inside the solar circle), while the atomic hydrogen $\\rm H$ can be found from $3\\ \\rm kpc$ out to the edge of the Galactic disk ($25\\ \\rm kpc$).  It appears that $\\rm H_2$ and the dust are more tightly confined to the Galactic plane, with vertical scale heights above or below the midplane of $\\lesssim 90\\ \\rm pc$.  This is only about $25\\%$ of the value for stars in the thin disk  and on the order of $9\\%$ of the scale height of thick-disk stars.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the region near the Sun, the scale height for atomic hydrogen is approximately $160\\ \\rm pc$.  The total mass of H I is estimated to be $3\\times 10^9\\ M_\\odot$, and the mass of $\\rm H_2$ is ${\\sim}10^9\\ M_\\odot$.  In the solar neighborhood, the total mass density of gas is $0.04\\ M_\\odot/{\\rm pc^3}$, where hydrogen accounts for approximately $77\\%$ of it, molecules contribute $17\\%$, and ions add an additional $6\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At distances beyond $12\\ \\rm kpc$ from the Galactic center, the scale heigh of H I increases dramatically, extending up to $900\\ \\rm pc$.  In addition, the distribution of H I in the outer reaches of the Galaxy is no longer strictly confined to the plane, but exhibits a well-defined **warp** that reaches a maximum deviation angle from the plane of $15^\\circ$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Warped H I distributions (e.g., the one observed in our own Galaxy) appear to be common features in other spiral galaxies, including Andromeda, and in some spiral galaxies the warp angle can reach $90^\\circ$.  Warps do not seem to the result of simple gravitational perturbations from one or more external galaxies, but they do seem to associated with the distribution of mass in the outer regions of the Galaxy (beyond where most of the luminosity is produced).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrogen clouds can be found at high latitudes. Although some of these clouds have positive radial velocities (implying that they are moving away from the disk), the majority possess large negative radial velocities (up to $400\\ \\rm km/s$ or more), as measured by their 21-cm emission.  There appear to be two types of sources responsible for these **high-velocity clouds**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Galactic fountain model**: Clouds of gas ejected from supernovae are driven to large values of $z$, where they eventually cool and rain back down onto the Galactic plane.\n",
    "   - It also appears that the Galaxy is accreting gas from *intergalactic* space and from its small satellite galaxies, which explains the predominance of negative radial velocity clouds.\n",
    "2. **Coronal gas**: A very hot, tenuous gas exists at distances up to or exceeding $70 \\rm kpc$ from the Galactic center.\n",
    "   - The *Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer* (FUSE) has detected $\\rm O\\ VI$ absorption lines in the spectra of distant extragalactic sources and halo stars produced when the light passes through the gas in the Galactic halo.\n",
    "   - Using $\\rm O\\ VI$ as a tracer of the hydrogen gas, the strengths of $\\rm O\\ VI$ absorption lines imply a number density of hydrogen $n_H \\sim 10^{-11}\\ \\rm m^{-3}$. \n",
    "   - Assuming that the distribution is approximately spherical with a radius of $R\\sim 70\\ \\rm kpc$ leads to an estimate for the mass of the gas $M_{\\rm gas} \\simeq 4 \\times 10^8\\ M_\\odot$.\n",
    "   - To support the gas against gravitational collapse, the gas temperature must be very hot.  It is estimated to be in excess of $10^6\\ \\rm K$ (similar to the Sun's corona), with the high gas temperature perhaps being due to collisions between infalling gas and existing gas in the Galaxy.\n",
