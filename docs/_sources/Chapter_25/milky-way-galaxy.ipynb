    "# The Milky Way Galaxy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Counting the Stars in the Sky\n",
    "Humans have peered into the heavens and contemplated its vastness.  Sometimes, we have proposed various models to explain its form.  In some civilizations, the stars were believed to be on a celestial sphere that rotated majestically above a fixed, central Earth (i.e., geocentrism of Ptolemy).  When Galileo made his first telescopic observations, we started down a long road that has dramatically expanded our view of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "it is possible to get at least a general idea about the nature of other galaxies by studying our own Galaxy, but this is very challenging.  We live in a disk of stars, dust, and gas that severely impacts our ability to \"see\" beyond our relative stellar neighborhood when we look along the plane of the disk.  The problem is most severe when looking toward the center of the Galaxy in the constellation Sagittarius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of what we know today about the formation and evolution of the Milky Way is encoded in the motions of the Galaxy's constituents, especially when combined with information about the variations in composition.  Unfortunately, measuring the motions of the stars and gas in the Galaxy is done from a moving observing platform (i.e., the Earth) that is undergoing another motion around the Sun, which is orbiting the Galactic center.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical Models\n",
    "From observations of a *dark* night sky, an almost continuous band of light appears to circle the Earth.  It is inclined by about $60^\\circ$ with respect to the celestial equator.  It was Galileo who first realized that this Milky Way is a vast collection of individual stars.  In the mid-1700s, Kant and Wright proposed that the Galaxy must be a stellar disk and our Solar System is merely one component within that disk.  In the 1780s, William Herschel produced a map of the Milky Way based crudely on counting the number of stars the he could observe in 683 regions of the sky.  In his analysis, Herschel assumed that\n",
    "\n",
    "- all stars have approximately the same *absolute* magnitude,\n",
    "- the number density of stars in space is roughly constant,\n",
    "- there is nothing between the stars to obscure them, and \n",
    "- he could see the the *edges* of the stellar distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "From his data, Herschel concluded that the Sun had to be very near the center of the distribution and that the dimensions measured along the plane of the disk were some $5\\times$ greater than the disk's vertical thickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jacobus Kapteyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_Kapteyn) confirmed Herschel's model of the Galaxy, again using the technique of star counting.  Through the use of more quantitative methods, Kapteyn was able specify a distance scale for his model of the Galaxy.  The **Kapteyn universe** was a flattened spheroidal system with a steadily decreasing stellar density with increasing distance from the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the plane of the Galaxy and at a distance of some $800\\ \\rm pc$ from the center, the number density of stars had decreased from its central value by a factor of $2$.  On an axis passing through teh center and perpendicular to the central plane, the number density decreased by $50\\%$ over a distance of only $150\\ \\rm pc$.  The number density diminished to $1\\%$ of its central value at distances of $8500\\ \\rm pc$ (in the plane) and $1700\\ \\rm pc$ (perpendicular to the plane).  Kapteyn concluded that the Sun was located $38\\ \\rm pc$ north of the Galactic midplane and $650\\ \\rm pc$ from the center, measured along the Galactic midplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow Kapteyn's logic for his nearly heliocentric model of the universe, recall the equation for the distance modulus:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "m-M &= 5\\log_{10}\\left( \\frac{d}{10\\ \\rm pc}\\right), \\\\\n",
    "d &= 10^{(m-M+5)/5}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a value for $M$ (e.g., if the spectral class and luminosity class are known) and measuring $m$ at a telescope, the distance modulus $m-M$ and the distance $d$ are readily obtained.  Given the known coordinates of the star on the celestial sphere, its 3D position relative to the Earth is determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In actuality, it is impractical to estimate the distance to each individual star in the way described above because the number of stars in any given region is so great.  Instead, a statistical approach is used that is based on counting the number of stars in specified region down to a predetermined limiting apparent magnitude.  From this counting procedure, the number density of stars at a given distance can be estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly before Kapteyn's model was published, Harlow Shapley estimated the distances to 93 globular clusters using [RR Lyrae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RR_Lyrae_variable) and [W Virginis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_Virginis) stars.  These stars are easily identified in the clusters through their periodic variations in luminosity, and it is a matter of using the period-luminosity relation (to get their absolute magnitudes) to estimate their distances from the Sun.  The distances to the variable stars correspond to the distances to the clusters in which they reside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapley recognized that the globular clusters are not distributed uniformly throughout space, but are found preferentially in a region of the sky that is centered in the constellation of Sagittarius, at $15\\ \\rm kpc$ from the Sun.  He estimated that the most distant clusters are more than $70 \\rm kpc$ form the Sun, over $55\\ \\rm kpc$ from the center.  As a result, Shapley believed that the diameter of the Galaxy was on the order of $100 \\rm kpc$, which is close to $10 \\times$ the diameter estimated by Kapteyn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we known that Kapteyn's universe was too small and the Sun was too near the center, and Shapley's Galactic model was too large.  Both models errored in part for the same reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the failure to include in their distance estimates the effects of interstellar extinction due to gas and dust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kapteyn's selected regions were largely within the Galactic disk where extinction effects are most severe; as a result, he was unable to see the most distant portions of the Milky Way (causing him to underestimate its size).  The problem is analogous to someone on Earth trying to see the surrounding land while standing in a dense fog with limited visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapely chose to study objects that are generally found well above (and below) the plane of the Milky Way, and are inherently bright, which makes them visible from great distances.  It is in directions perpendicular to the disk that interstellar extinction is least important, although it cannot be neglected entirely.  Errors in the calibration of the period-luminosity relation used by Shapely let to overestimates of the distances to the clusters.  The calibration errors were traced to the effects of interstellar extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kapteyn was aware of the errors that interstellar extinction could introduce but he was unable to find any quantitative evidence for the effect.  Other researchers at the time suspected that dust might be responsible for the dark bands running across the Milky Way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Further evidence for strong extinction could also be found in Shapely's own data.  No globular clusters were visible within a region between approximately $\\pm 10^\\circ$ of the Galactic plane called the **zone of avoidance**.  Shapely suggested that globular clusters were apparently absent in the zone of avoidance because strong gravitational tidal forces disrupted the objects in that region; this was a similar argument for the existence of the Asteroid Belt in the Solar System.  In reality, interstellar extinction is so severe within the zone of avoidance that the very bright clusters are simply undetectable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Effects of Interstellar Extinction\n",
    "To see how interstellar extinction directly affects the estimates of stellar distances, we find\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "d = 10^{(m_\\lambda - M_\\lambda - A_\\lambda + 5)/5} = d^\\prime 10^{-A_\\lambda/5},\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d^\\prime = 10^{(m_\\lambda - M_\\lambda + 5)/5}$ is the erroneous estimate of the distance when extinction is neglected, and $A_\\lambda$ is the amount of extinction in magnitudes.  The extinction coefficient and magnitudes ($M$ and $m$) are all a function of wavelength due to the wavelength dependent way that light is scattered (or blocked) by dust or absorbed by gas clouds.  Since $A_\\lambda \\geq 0$ in all cases (i.e., extinction can't make a star appear brighter), $d\\leq d^\\prime$; the true distance is always less than the apparent distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the disk of the Milky Way, the typical extinction rate in visible wavelengths is $1\\ \\rm mag/kpc$.  The value can vary dramatically if the line of sight includes distinct nebulae (e.g., molecular clouds).  Fortunately, it is often possible to estimate the amount of extinction by considering how dust affect the color of a star (i.e., interstellar reddening).\n",

    "**Suppose that a B0 main-sequence star with an absolute visual magnitude of $M_V = -4.0$ is observed to have an apparent visual magnitude of $m_V = V = + 8.2$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Neglecting interstellar extinction, what would be the estimated distance to the star?*\n",

    "\n",
    "*What would be the estimated distance including some effect of interstellar extinction?*\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is known by some independent means (e.g., reddening) that the amount of extinction along the line of sight is $1\\ \\rm mag/kpc$, then $A_V = kd\\ \\rm mag$, where $k = 10^{-3}\\ \\rm mag/pc$ and $d$ is measured in $\\rm pc$.  This gives\n",

    "which may be solved iteratively (or graphically) giving a true distance to the star of $d = 1400\\ \\rm pc$.\n",
    "\n",
    "in this case the distance to the star would have been overestimated by almost a factor of two fi the effects of interstellar extinction were not properly accounted for.\n",

    "### Differential and Integrated Star Counts\n",
    "Kapteyn's method of star counting was not based on directly determining $d$ for individual stars.  Rather, the number of stars visible in selected regions of the sky are counted over a specified apparent magnitude range.  Alternatively, all stars in the regions brighter than a chose limit of apparent magnitude can be counted.  These approaches are known as **differential** and **integrated star counts**, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique of star is still used today to determine the number density of stars in the sky.  The distribution depends on a variety of parameters, including the direction, distance, chemical composition, and spectral classification.  Such information is very helpful to astronomers in their efforts to understand the structure and evolution of the Milky Way.\n",
