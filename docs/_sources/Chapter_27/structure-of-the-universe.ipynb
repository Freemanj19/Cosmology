    "### Unveiling the 3rd Dimension\n",
    "In 1761, the method of trigonometric parallax was used to measure the distance to Venus, thereby calibrating the size of Kepler's Solar System.  [Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Bessel) measured the subtle annual shift in the position of [61 Cygni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/61_Cygni) (in 1862), where he combined the parallax method with his knowledge with the measured size of Earth's orbit to discover that 61 Cyg is ${\\sim}650,000\\ \\rm AU$ away (or ${\\sim}10\\ \\rm ly$; $1\\ {\\rm ly} = 63,241\\ {\\rm AU}$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the surveyor's method of trigonometric parallax can reach out past the Galactic center, or to ${\\sim}9.2\\ \\rm kpc$ with the [Gaia telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)).  Another method of distance determination was with the moving cluster method that made it possible to determine the distance to the Hyades cluster.  The technique of main-sequence fitting (or spectroscopic parallax) can be used to find the distances to open clusters out to about $7\\ \\rm kpc$ by comparing their main sequences on an H-R diagram with that of the Hyades cluster.  The repeated application of a variety of methods using this pattern of calibration and measurement constitutes the steps of the **extragalactic distance scale**, or the *cosmological distance ladder*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Wilson-Bappu Effect\n",
    "Spectroscopic parallax can (in principle) provide reliable distances to remote stars out to ${\\sim}7\\ \\rm Mpc$ away, although in practice it is employed with in a few $100\\ \\rm kpc$ and is far enough to reach the Magellanic Clouds.  Some stars have specific feature in their spectra that allow their absolute magnitudes (and hence their distances) to be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the K absorption line of $\\rm Ca$ can be quite broad, reaching maximum strength at spectral type $\\rm K0$.  In late-type stars with chromospheres (e.g., $G,\\ K,\\ \\text{and } M$ spectral types), a narrow emission line is seen, centered on the wide K absorption line.  The width of this emission line is strongly correlated with a star's absolute visual magnitude, valid over a range of $15$ magnitudes, and called the **Wilson-Bappu effect** ([Wilson & Vainu Bappu (1957)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1957ApJ...125..661W/abstract)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cepheid Distance Scale\n",
    "For more distant objects, astronomers turn to the [period-luminosity relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period-luminosity_relation) for Cepheids.  Before this relation could be used, it had to be calibrated by finding a classical Cepheid.  The nearest one (Polaris) was too far away (${\\sim}200\\ \\rm pc$) for trigonometric parallax to be useful when the first calibrations were being performed in the early 20th century.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1913, Ejnar Hertzsprung used the Sun's motion of $16.5\\ \\rm km/s$ with respect to the LSR to provide a longer baseline for parallax measurements.  It was this technique of [secular parallax](https://saturnaxis.github.io/Cosmology/Chapter_25/milky-way-galaxy.html#some-methods-for-determining-distances) that enabled him to determine the average distance to a classical Cepheid with a period of $6.6\\ \\rm days$.  Hertzsprung then used this information to calibrate the period-luminosity relation, where Shapley carried out a similar procedure.  The distances to more Cepheids have been measured by parallax and other methods since then, and the period-luminosity relation has become well established.  Astronomer today use a period-luminosity relation in the form ([Marengo et al. (2010)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/709/1/120/pdf))\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "M_V = \\alpha\\left[\\log_{10} P -1.0 \\right] + \\beta,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta$ accounts for the finite width of the instability strip on the H-R diagram.  Carroll & Ostlie (2007) use $\\alpha = -3.53$ and $\\beta = 2.13(B-V) - 5.66$, where Marengo et al. (2010) use $\\alpha = -3.37 \\pm 0.06$ and $\\beta = -5.65 \\pm 0.02$ in the K band.  In both cases, $P$ is the pulsation period in units of days, where $B-V$ refers to the color index.  For classical Cepheids $B-V\\approx 0.4\\text{ to } 1.1$.  After the star's absolute magnitude has been calculated, it can be combined with the star's apparent magnitude to give its distance modulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cepheid variable stars immediately proved their worth as stellar yardsticks.  It was in 1917 that Shapley measured the distances to Pop II Cepheids in globular clusters, thereby determining his estimates for the diameter of the Galaxy and the distance of the Sun from its center.  In 1923, Edwin Hubble discovered several Cepheid in M31 and announced that it was $285\\ \\rm kpc$ away.  It was Hubble's series of observations that established M31 as an external galaxy, not a smaller nebula within the borders of the Milky Way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The existence of a correlation between a Cepheid's pulsation period and it absolute magnitude meant that these stars could be used as standard candles to determine distances many years *before* the physical processes that cause the pulsations were understood.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the time, it was not known that 3 types of pulsating stars were used to determine the size of the Galaxy and the distance to M31.  Although the existence of interstellar dust clouds had been established, the existence of diffuse interstellar dust and gas capable of extinguishing starlight had not yet been demonstrated.  Leavitt's variables in the Magellanic Clouds were classical Cepheids (Pop I stars), while those observed in the globular clusters by Shapely were W Virginis and RR Lyrae stars (both Pop II).\n",
    "\n",
    "The W Viriginis stars are about $1.5\\ \\text{mag}$ fainter than classical Cepheids of the same period, which corresponds to a lower luminosity by a factor of 4.  After Hertzsprung and (later) Shapley calibrated the period-luminosity relation, they used nearby classical Cepheids but neglected the effect of extinction.  Neither realized that dust in the Galactic disk dimmed these stars by (coincidentally) about $1.5\\ \\text{mag}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By chance the resulting period-luminosity relation was just about right when used with W Virginis stars.  However, it would give an underluminous result with classical Cepheids.  When Hubble used this calibration to determine the distance to M31, the apparent magnitudes of his Cepheids were correct but his estimates of the absolute magnitudes were too large.  Consequently, their distance module $(m-M)$ and the distances themselves were underestimated.  The stars were thought to be **dimmer and closer** rather than *brighter and farther away*, and so their parent galaxies were measured at roughly 1/2 of their actual distances **and** half their actual sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapley fared no better with his observations of the (unknown to him) W Virginis stars in the globular clusters.  Although he unwittingly used the right variety of star for the calibration of the period-luminosity relation.  Extinction due to dust within the Galactic disk dimmed the starlight and increased the stars' apparent magnitudes.  Because the importance of extinction was not yet recognized, Shapely incorrectly attributed his stars' faintness to their remoteness.  As a result, his distances to the globular clusters were too great, as was the size he calculated for the Galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something was obviously wrong.  It appeared that the Milky Way was much larger than any of the galaxies surveyed.  [Trumpler (1930)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1930LicOB..14..154T/abstract) showed that interstellar extinction could remedy part of the problem.  The rest of the puzzle was solved by [Baade (1956)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1956PASP...68....5B/abstract), who showed that there are two types of Cepheids: (1) the classical Cepheids and (2) the intrinsically fainter W Virginis stars.  With these corrections, the measured distances and sizes of the other galaxies doubled and the Milky Way was reduced to a size that was a bit smaller than M31.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1990s, the calibration of the period-luminosity relation was carried out using data obtained by the Hipparcos mission.  Hipparcos astronomers measured the parallax angles of 273 Cepheids and used the resulting distances to derive the period-luminosity relation.  This was the first period-luminosity relation obtained from a direct distance measurement, and it is interesting that the result was nearly identical to an expression obtained by [Sandage & Tammann (1968)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1968ApJ...151..531S/abstract).  Although further adjustments are sure to follow Cepheids certainly provide a firm foundation measuring the distances to other galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interstellar extinction is still the largest source of error when Cepheids are used as standard candles, and there may also be a weak dependence on metallicity.  The extinction problem can be reduced by observing these stars at IR wavelengths, since IR light more readily penetrates dusty regions.  Because Cepheids are about $3\\times$ dimmer in the IR, astronomers have not stopped searching for them at visible wavelengths.\n",

    "### Supernovae as Distance Indicators\n",
    "Supernovae can be used in several ways to measure extragalactic distances.  Suppose the angular extent $\\theta(t)$ of a supernova's photosphere is observed.  The angular velocity of the expanding gases $\\omega\\ (=\\Delta \\theta/\\Delta t)$ can be found by comparing two observations separated by a time $\\Delta t$.  If $d$ is the distance to the supernova, then the transverse velocity of the expanding photosphere is $v_\\theta = \\omega d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the expansion is spherically symmetric, the transverse velocity should be equal to the ejecta's radial velocity $v_{\\rm ej}$ obtained from the supernova's Doppler-shifted spectral lines.  Then the distance to the supernova is $d= v_{\\rm ej}/omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most supernovae are too distant for the above method to be employed, where another strategy is adopted.  It assumes that the expanding shell of hot gases radiates as a blackbody.  Then the supernova's luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L = 4\\pi \\sigma R^2(t)T_{e}^4, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R(t)$ is the radius of the expanding photosphere and $t$ is the age of the supernova.  If we assume that the ejecta's radial velocity has remained nearly constant, then $R(t) = v_{\\rm ej}t$.  The effective temperature $T_e$ of the photosphere comes from the characteristics of its blackbody spectrum.  Once the luminosity is found, it can be converted to an absolute magnitude and then used to find the distance to the supernova by comparing it with the apparent magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The photosphere of the expanding shell of a supernova is neither perfectly spherical nor a perfect blackbody.  Difficulties with accurate values for interstellar extinction plague both methods, but the problem is more acute for core-collapse supernovae (Types Ib, Ic, and II), which are found near sites of recent star formation.  Typical uncertainties in the distances obtained range from $15-25\\%$ for M101 to the Virgo cluster of galaxies, respectively.\n",

    "From the sizes of their expanding photospheres, novae can be used in the same manner as supernovae to determine distances.  Although there is a wide variation in the absolute magnitudes of novae at peak light, there is a relation between a nova's maximum visual magnitude $M_v^{\\rm max}$ and the time it takes for its visible light to decline by two magnitudes.  *Consequently, novae can serve as standard candles.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical reason why this relationship holds for novae is that more massive, smaller white dwarfs produce greater compression and heating of the accreted gases on their surfaces.  A runaway thermonuclear reaction may be initiated with a smaller accumulated mass.  The less massive surface layers are more readily ejected, and the nova declines more rapidly.  The average rate of decline over the first $2\\ \\rm mag$ is written as $\\dot{m}$ (in $\\rm mag/day$) and can be expressed as\n",

    "Measurements of the angular sizes of the H II regions and the apparent magnitude of the galaxy can be compared with similar measurements for other galaxies with known distances.  This makes it possible to calculate the H II regions' linear sizes (in $\\rm pc$), along with the galaxy's absolute magnitude.

    "## The Expansion of the Universe\n",
    "In the early 1900s, astronomers began making systematic observations of the galactic radial velocities by measuring their Doppler-shifted spectral lines.  It was hoped that if the motions of these objects were found to be random, then the Sun's motion in the Milky Wya should be related to the vector sum of the radial velocities of the spiral nebulae.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was [Vesto Slipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesto_M._Slipher) who first discovered that this plan was doomed to failure.  The velocities of the spiral nebulae were *not* random.  Instead, most of the spectra showed redshifted spectral lines.  Slipher announced in 1914 that most of the 12 galaxies he surveyed were rapidly moving *away* from Earth, although M31's blueshifted spectrum indicated it was approaching Earth at nearly $300\\ \\rm km/s$.  It was quickly realized that these galaxies were not *only* moving away from Earth but moving away from each other as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Astronomers began to talk about these galactic motions in terms of an expansion.  Meanwhile, Slipher continuted his measurements, and by 1925, he had examined $40$ galaxies with spectra showing redshifted lines were much more common than those exhibiting blueshifts.  Slipher concluded that nearly every galaxy he examined was rapidly receding from Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hubble's Law of Universal Expansion\n",
    "In 1925, Hubble discovered Cepheid variable stars in M31, which established that the Andromeda \"nebula\" was in fact an external galaxy.  Hubble continued his search for Cepheids, while determining the distances to $18$ galaxies.  He combined his results with Slipher's velocities and discovered tha a galaxy's recessional velocity $v$ was proportional to its distance $d$.  In 1929, Hubble presented his results in a paper at a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences ([Hubble (1929)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1929PNAS...15..168H/abstract)), which included the relation,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "v = H_o d.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "This relation is today called **Hubble's law**, where the proportionality constant is called the **Hubble constant** $H_o$.  The recessional velocity is usually given in $\\rm km/s$ and the distance $d$ in $\\rm Mpc$, so Hubble's constant $H_o$ has units of $\\rm km/s/Mpc$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hubble realized that he had discovered an exceptionally powerful method of finding distance to remote galaxies simply by measuring their redshifts.  his early results show a linear fit to a scattering of points on a graph of velocity $v$ vs. distance $d$.  Hubble continued to compile distances and redshifts to strengthen this relationship, with much of the work done my his assistant, [Milton Humason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_L._Humason).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Humason literally worked his up to the top at Mt. Wilson Observatory, where he started out as a mule packer when the observatory was begin constructed.  Then, he served as a restaurant busboy, janitor, and night assistant at Mt. Wilson.  After Humason gained permission to observe on the smaller telescopes, Hubble was so impressed with the results that Humason ended up as his assistant.  Humason exposed and measured most of the photographic plates himself.  By 1934, the distances and velocities of $32$ galaxies were obtained and the expansion of the universe became an observational feature of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the idea of a universal expansion was simultaneously being developed by theorists.  [Willem de Sitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Sitter) used Einstein's theory of general relativity to describe a universe that was **expanding**.  Although de Sitter's solution of Einstein's equations described a vacuum (universe devoid of matter), it did predict a redshift that increased with the distance from the light's origin.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hubble was aware of de Sitter's work, where Hubble referenced the expansion ast the de Sitter effect.  Other theorists later found additional solutions that also indicated a universal expansion, but astronomers were unaware of their results until 1930.  Einstein himself initially favored a *static* universe that was neither expanding nor contracting.  However, the observations of Hubble and Humason forced Einstein to abandon this view in 1930.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Expansion of Space and the Hubble Flow\n",
    "To understand what *the expansion of the universe* really means, suppose that the Earth were to expand, doubling in size during an hour's time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, Yellowstone National Park is $500\\ \\rm km$ from Salt Lake City; Albuquerque is $1000\\ \\rm km$ away; and Minneapolis is at $2000\\ \\rm km$.  An hour later, each of these distances have doubled (e.g., Yellowstone is now $1000\\ \\rm km$) so that a Salt Lake City resident would find Yellowstone drifted away at $500\\ \\rm km/hr$, Albuquerque moved away at $1000\\ \\rm km/hr$, and Minneapolis receded at $2000\\ \\rm km/hr$.  Thus a recessional velocity that is proportional to distance is the natural result of an expansion that is both **isotropic** and **homogenous** (i.e., same in magnitude in every direction and at every location).  Observers in yellow stone, Albuquerque, and Minneapolis would arrive at the same conclusion.  Everyone involved in the expansion sees everyone else moving away with a velocity that obey's Hubble's law.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a vital distinction between the velocity of a galaxy through space (i.e., **peculiar velocity**) and its **recessional velocity** due to the expansion of the universe.  A galaxy's recessional velocity is *not* due to its motion through space; instead the galaxy is being *carried* along with the surrounding space as the universe expands.  The motion of galaxies as they participate in the expansion of the universe is the **Hubble flow**.  In the same manner, a galaxy's **cosmological redshift** is produced by the expansion as the wavelength of the light emitted by the galaxy is stretched along with the space through which the light travels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the cosmological redshift is not related to the galaxy's recessional velocity by the Doppler shift equations.  Those equations were derived for a static, *Euclidean* spacetime and do not include the effects of the expanding, *curved* spacetime of our universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, astronomers frequently translate a measured redshift $z$ into a radial velocity that a galaxy would have *if* it had a peculiar velocity instead of its actual recessional velocity.  For example, the statement that *quasar SDSS 1030+0524 appears to be moving away from us at more than $96\\%$ of the speed of light* must be interpreted with the above caveat in mind.  For $z \\leq 2$, the distance estimate obtained using Hubble's law ([Davis & Lineweaver (2004)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PASA...21...97D/abstract)),\n",

    "### The Value of the Hubble Constant\n",
    "In principle, Hubble's law can be used to find the distance to any galaxy whose redshift can be measured.  The stumbling block to carrying out this procedure has been the uncertainty in the [Hubble constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law).  Through the end of the 20th century, $H_o$ was known within a factor of two, between $50-100\\ \\rm km/s/Mpc$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, the difficulty in determining the value of $H_o$ arose from using remote galaxies for its calibration.  A major source of the diverse values of $H_o$ obtained by different researchers lay in their choice (and ues) of secondary distance indicators when measuring remote galaxies.  There are also large-scale motions of galaxies relative to the Hubble flow that are being sorted out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there is a selection effect called a [Malmquist bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malmquist_bias) that must be guarded against.  This can occur when using a magnitude-limited sample of objects, where objects brighter than a certain *apparent* magnitude are used.  At larger distances, only the intrinsically brightest objects will be included in the sample, which will skew the statistics unless corrected for.\n",
