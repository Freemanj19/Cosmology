    "Students will work in pairs to produce summaries of each class meeting.  These summaries should list the main topics discussed and emphasized ideas/examples during the respective lecture.  Students are encouraged to be as detailed as possible without being overly verbose.  The summaries should be submitted as a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor) from **your forked repository** before the next class meeting.\n"
