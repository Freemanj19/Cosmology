    "### Evidence of Interactions\n",
    "Nearly all galaxies belong to clusters, and the galaxies take up a larger fraction of the cluster's volume than do stars in a stellar cluster.  The spacing between galaxies is typically only $100\\times$ larger than the size of the galaxies themselves.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Densely populated clusters (e.g., the Coma cluster) have a higher proportion of elliptical galaxies (i.e., early-type) in their center than they do in their outer, less dense regions.  The central regions of these rich, regularly shaped clusters also have a higher proportions of ellipticals than the centers of less populated, amorphous irregular clusters (e.g., Hercules cluster).  These observations seem to correlate with the increased probability of interactions and/or mergers between galaxies in regions of higher galaxy number density.  Interactions tend to increase the velocity dispersions of stars within each of the galaxies involved, which could possibly destroy disk structures in spiral (late-type) galaxies and cause the galaxies to relax to early-type $r^{1/4}$ profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "A VLA radio survey of the H I layer of galactic disks found that at least $50\\%$ of all disk galaxies display warped disks.  Also, more than half of all ellipticals harbor discrete shells of stars (see [Binney (1992)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ARA%26A..30...51B/abstract) and [Hernquist (1992)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ApJ...400..460H/abstract) for more details).  Some disk warping may be due to tidal interactions with smaller satellite galaxies and shells in ellipticals are signatures of mergers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations suggest that hot, X-ray emitting gas occupies much of the space between galaxies in rich clusters and has a mass equal to (or exceeding) the mass of all the cluster's stars.  It seems that the gravitational influence of interacting galaxies is largely responsible for removing the gas from the individual galaxies that make up the cluster, while still leaving the gas trapped in the cluster's gravitational well.  Only a small fraction of the galaxies' gas is removed in a direct collision, where mergers may initiate a burst of star formation that produces stellar mass loss and supernovae.  This can also lead to a galactic superwind capable of liberating a large amount of gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evidence suggests that interactions between galaxies play an important role in their evolution.  In the hierarchical \"bottom-up\" scenario of galaxy formation, large galaxies are formed by mergers and the gravitational capture of smaller entities.  In this view, the interactions seen today between galaxies are simply a natural extension of their formative years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamical Friction\n",
    "*What happens when galaxies collide?*  Given that stars are generally spread very far apart in galaxies, the change of even  single stellar collision is quite small.  Instead, interactions between stars will be gravitational in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that an object (e.g., a globular cluster or small galaxy) of mass $M$ is moving through an infinite collection of stars, gas clouds , and dark matter with a constant density $\\rho$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assumption**: The mass of each object in the background \"sea\" of material is much less than $M$, so $M$ continues to move in a straight line instead of being deflected.\n",
    "- In the absence of collisions, $M$ might move unimpeded.  But, as $M$ moves forward the other objects are gravitationally pulled toward its path, with the closest ones feeling the largest force.\n",
    "- This produces a region of enhanced density along the path, with a high-density \"wake\" trailing $M$.  The net gravitational force on $M$ that opposes its motion is called **dynamical friction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Kinetic energy is transferred from $M$ to the surrounding material as the speed of $M$ is reduced.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical quantities involved in dynamical friction are the mass $M$, the speed $v_M$ of the massive object, and the mass density $\\rho$ of the surrounding material.  AS a result, the expression for the force must contain $GM$, $v_M$, and $\\rho$ only.  The expression for the force of dynamical friction is will have the following form,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f_d \\simeq C \\left(\\frac{GM}{v_M} \\right)^2 \\rho,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C$ is dimensionless, but not a constant.  It is a function that depends on how $v_M$ compares with the velocity dispersion $\\sigma$ of the surrounding medium (see [Binney & Tremaine (1987)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987gady.book.....B/abstract) for more details).  For $v_M \\sim 3\\sigma$, the typical values of $C are \n",
    "\n",
    "- 23 for the LMC,\n",
    "- 76 for globular clusters, and\n",
    "- 160 for ellipticals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly the dynamical friction must be proportional to the mass density of stars.  Assuming that the relative numbers of objects of various objects don't change, doubling $\\rho$ means doubling the number of objects and would double the gravitational force on $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass $M$ itself is squared, where one power comes from its role in producing the high-density wake that trails behind it and the other from the gravitational force on $M$ produced by the enhanced density.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the velocity squared term in the denominator.  If $M$ moves twice as fast, it will spend only half as much time near a given object.  The impulse $(\\int \\mathbf{F}dt = \\Delta \\mathbf{p})$ given to that object is only half as great.  Consequently, the density enhancement develops only half as rapidly, and $M$ will be twice as far away by the time the enhancement arises.  Thus, slow encounters are much more effective at decreasing the speed of an intruding mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an estimate of the timescale associated with the effects of dynamical friction acting on a galaxy's globular clusters, recall that flat rotation curves imply that the density of the dark matter halo may be approximated simply by,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\rho(r) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi G}\\left(\\frac{v_M}{r}\\right)^2. $$\n",

    "&= C \\frac{GM^2}{4\\pi r^2}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "If the cluster's orbit is circular with a radius $r$, then its orbital angular momentum is $L = M v_M r$.  Since dynamical friction acts tangentially to the orbit and opposes the cluster's motion, a torque of magnitude $\\tau = rf_d$ is exerted on the cluster.  The torque reduces the cluster's angular momentum according to \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dL}{dt} = \\tau. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "A flat rotation curve implies that the orbital speed $v_M$ is essentially constant.  Thus differentiating the angular momentum and substituting for the torque gives,\n",
