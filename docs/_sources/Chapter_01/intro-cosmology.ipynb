    "# Introduction to Cosmology\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Cosmology?\n",
    "\n",
    "The root of Cosmology is derived from the Ancient Greek word κόσμος (kósmos), which is the study of the universe.  The 'universe' has different definitions and sizes over time, where the first notions of the cosmos was probably limited to the world visible to the naked eye.  This included the land, seas, and sky as they are our interface with the world.  Much of early human civilization depended on determining how to control (or at least interpret) these divisions of the world.  The land produced agriculture through herd animals and grain, while the seas provided a bounty in its marine life.  The changing sky affected both of these domains because the land and sea were more productive during particular times of year.  Therefore a knowledge of the sky was *necessary* for survival within the **chaos** of the world.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the basics of sustenance living, cosmology quickly develops into two types: religious (or mythological) cosmology and physical cosmology.  Either form needs to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does the *world* currently work?\n",
    "2. Where did everything in the *world* originate?\n",
    "3. How does the origin of everything relate to the current structure of the *world*?\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the *world* changes over time, where it can mean the Earth itself or objects deeper within the night sky (i.e., the Universe).  Answering these questions is fundamental for human societies to develop their relative position and to produce ways of interacting with the world.   From this foundation human civilization is built, which can use its cosmology to justify any number of choices it must make.  Physical (or scientific) cosmology is not immune to these tendencies, where the dogma of the static Universe permeated the western scientific world of the early 20th century.  Modern cosmology is largely characterized by understanding the largest structures of the visible Universe and how they move relative to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the Universe work?\n",
    "This is largely a question of mechanism, where early societies identified cause and effect through the seasons.  The much cooler winter months followed a hotter warmer period, where more temperate months intervened between these extremes depending on the latitude.  Something must be causing this cycle, where many cultures identified the Sun as the culprit. *But why is the Sun responsible?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Many cultures answered this question by deifying the Sun and established ritual to appease the deity.  Beyond the rituals, an explanation for the rising/setting of the Sun and a broader separation of order from chaos became a central tenant in the *right to rule*.  The Universe works because the Sun god is satisfied and the highest leader within the society is somehow related (through a direct lineage or communication with) to the divine.  Other civilizations made allegorical stories to explain the observations (e.g., Persephone, Demeter, and Hades).\n",

    "\n",
    "To the ancient Mediterranean states (e.g., Greek, Roman, Persian, and Egyptian), individuals came forth with observations that identify correlations of the Sun's position in the sky with particular outcomes on the Earth.  However, there were some other stars that appeared to wander through the night sky, which they called the *planets*.  A new explanation was now necessary to explain how the Universe works because these wanders sometimes appeared to defy the *natural order* imposed by the movement of the Sun.  Religious cosmologies typically extended the deification to the planets and gave them duties to explain more about the world.  This solution appeared satisfactory, but additional ritual was necessary to satisfy the new pantheon and a scheme to predict the motions of the planets was required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheme to predict the planetary motions had to be accurate as many more affairs of state became linked with their movements.  Festivals and other cultural events held parts of the society together and provided a direction for the centralized leadership.  Thus, the question of how the world works was broadened to how the celestial bodies (i.e., Sun, Moon, and planets) move relative to the Earth.  Two systems to describe these motions competed: geocentric (Earth-centered) and heliocentric (Sun-centered).  From the earliest Ancient Greek traditions, these systems had to compete with their ability to explain the *naked-eye* observations.  In this battle, the geocentric view was more likely to gain dominance because of the limitations of the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heliocentric description of how the Universe works would eventually overtake the geocentric view because of technological advancements that improved the observations.  With Lippershey's spyglass and Galileo's improvements on its design, the requisite observations could be made.  The religious domain of cosmology began to loose its usefulness (at least in Enlightenment era Europe) to the rise of physical cosmology.  A physical heliocentric cosmology could now make equal-quality predictions compared to the geocentric cosmology.  The transition wasn't as easy because of the religious overtones that gave the geocentric view its legitimacy.  However, Newton's physics actually made it easier to make accurate predictions of the planetary motions and could explain more events on Earth's surface.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Technological improvements to the telescope allowed individuals to peer deeper in to the darkness of the night sky.  From these new observations, natural philosophers identified that some stars orbited each other, there were other bodies in our Solar System beyond the *classical* planets, and the distances to nearby stars could estimated through an ancient technique of parallax.  Modern conceptions of how the Universe works falls predominantly within a physical cosmology that is influenced by observations and measurement.  Additionally, the Universe has extended beyond the nearest stars to include collections of around 100 billion stars in the form of galaxies.  Religious cosmologies may still have a *sociological* function in how the world works, but do not hold as much authority as they once did.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where did everything come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another purpose of cosmology is to provide an explanation for the origin of everything.  This description has changed drastically over time, where the earliest cultures developed creation stories/myths.  These creation stories were typically not written down, but transferred orally from the elders to the children as they grow up.  Some oral histories were transmitted accurately this way, but others suffered from either errors or embellishments over several generations.  For example, a mortal foe was defeated by a sometime ago by a great *human* hero but over subsequent tellings, the foe becomes more animalistic and the hero obtains special abilities.  In the original Superman comic, Superman could run very fast and jump very high, but not fly.  Overtime, these two traits were combined into flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ancient cultures developed their stories using observations in their daily lives.  Exploring new lands uncovered new places that seemed to just be there.  Many creation myths mimic this motif with a narrative of a great being that brought the \"stuff\" into existence and molded it in someway so that it matches the observed land.  The order is separated from chaos, matter is separated from the void, light separated from dark, and the sky separated from the ground.  Another observation is that babies are created sometime after sexual intercourse, where the child has characteristics of both the mother and father.  Therefore, everything comes into being from a union between deities that have a special domain.\n",

    "\n",
    "Modern cosmology provides a similar function, but through a scientific view of nature, which is filled with particles that comprise all things.  The first step is to determine where the Sun comes from, which is described currently by stellar astrophysics and consists of the gravitational collapse of gas/dust clouds.  But the Sun is only one part of a larger galaxy of stars, which begs the question of where do galaxies originate?  Galaxies form through clusters of stars interacting with a special substance called **dark matter**, but the details of the dark matter are still being determined.  Larger structures form clusters of galaxies that all originated from an immense expansion of the Universe from a **big bang** event.  Naively, we may generalize that the modern view of cosmology is not that dissimilar from the more ancient view.  However, the distinction is in the details (i.e., a boulder is not just a really small mountain).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the origin story explain the current structure?\n",
    "Depending on your place in history, the origin of the universe may have a greater or lesser effect on your worldview.  The earliest descriptions of the Universe's were largely anthropomorphic extensions.  The biological processes for birth was the way of the world and the Universe's origin story was no exception.  After the creation of a substrate, which could be a plane (i.e., Minecraft style) or the back of a turtle, the flora and fauna of the world could arise.  The turbulent birth of the world produced the chaotic seas, volcanos, and earthquakes.  These natural disasters were just a part of life in the best of times and a punishment from the gods at the worst.  The gods themselves were fashioned to behave with human emotions, which furthered the chaotic sense of nature.\n",

    "\n",
    "The modern origin story in Astronomy is more direct, even mechanistic, in its approach to connect the beginning to the present.  But this was not always the case.  Only ${\\sim}100$ years ago, the Universe consisted of only the Milky Way and it was static (neither expanding nor contracting).  However, Hubble's distance measurements using Cepheids and Type 1a supernovae changed this view.  The Universe was much larger than assumed and it was expanding.  This meant that the Universe could have a beginning and thus, an origin story was not completely a human invention.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, a changing Universe means that we can map effects to potential causes using observations of the faintest galaxies.  From these observations, modern cosmologists have discovered that ${\\sim}25\\%$ of the Universe consists of so-called 'dark matter', which affects the formation and rotation of galaxies.  From our best observations, the Universe's expansion is not slowing down, but accelerating due to an unknown 'dark energy' that makes up ${\\sim}70\\%$ of everything.  The cosmic expansion due to a dark energy after the Universe's beginning (i.e., Big Bang) and the distribution of dark matter have shaped the largest structures across the visible Universe."
