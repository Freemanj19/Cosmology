# ASTR3220: Cosmology 
Lecture notes for ASTR3220 Cosmology at [Valdosta State University](https://www.valdosta.edu/phy/).  This course is designed using **An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics** by Carroll & Ostlie (2007), where it will include summaries of the course material and code implementation/exercises.  The course is divided into three sections (Introduction; Galaxies; and Universe) that will cover 3-4 chapters for each section from the textbook.  In addition to homework assignments and exams, each student will give an in-class presentation using information from an instructor-assigned:

- tutorial using astropy

and

- a topical scientific (peer-reviewed) paper

where both presentations will be assessed by both the instructor and fellow students.  The presentation using the astropy tutorials must explain to the class: how to use the relevant tools and connect to the material in the associated chapters of the textbook (as indicated below).

The JupyterBook can be found at [saturnaxis.github.io/Cosmology](https://saturnaxis.github.io/Cosmology/home.html)
