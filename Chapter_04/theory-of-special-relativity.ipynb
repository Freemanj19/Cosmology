    "A *wave* is a disturbance (or energy) that flows through a medium (e.g., water waves, sound waves).  [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell) combined the mathematical descriptions of electricity and magnetism, which together can describe light as \"modulations of the same medium through which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.\"  This insight did not precisely describe what was the medium through which light traveled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the late 19th century, physicists believed that light waves moved through a medium called the [luminiferous aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether), which is an all-pervading ether that had its roots in the science of early Greece.  The ancient Greeks believed that everything was composed of *five* elements: earth, air, fire, water, and the ether.  The ether was a more perfect element (compared to the other four) and was a major component of the crystalline spheres that held up the heavens.\n",

    "Scientists of the 1800s proposed the ether for the sole purpose of transporting light waves, where an object moving through the ether would experience **no mechanical resistance**, so Earth's velocity through the ether could not be directly measured.

Everyone measures exactly the same value for the speed of light, regardless of the velocity of the environment or the velocity of the source of the light.\n",

The contradiction between the Galilean transformation and the experimentally determined constant speed of light means that the Galilean transformation cannot be correct in all cases.  The Galilean transformations adequately describe the familiar low-speed world of everyday life (i.e., $v\\ll c$), but they are in sharp disagreement with the experimental results involving velocities near the speed of light, $v \\sim c$.
