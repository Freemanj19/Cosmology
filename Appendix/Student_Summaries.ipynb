    "Students will work in pairs to produce summaries of each class meeting.  These summaries should list the main topics discussed and emphasized ideas/examples during the respective lecture.  Students are encouraged to be as detailed as possible without being overly verbose.  The summaries should be submitted as a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor) from **your forked repository** before the next class meeting.\n"

    "### Class Overview\n",
    "- Introductions\n",
    "  - Dr. Quarles told us about his research.\n",
    "  - He studies how a planet's orbit evolves with two stars, where the changes in the planet's orbit can affect the climate through obliquity variations.  Obliquity is a way of describing a planet's spin axis, where it can precess (like a top) due to the perturbations from the companion star.  This precession can be responsible for large changes in obliquity.  Current models suggest that Mars may have undergone a climate catastrophe in part due to its obliquity variations, while the Earth's climate has been regulated by the Moon.\n",
    "- Syllabus\n",
    "  - The class syllabus provides us with a roadmap for the course.  \n",
    "  - The course is structured for the students to learn through class participation/activities and homework. \n",
    "  - Student learning will be assessed through exams and in-class presentations.\n",
    "- Course website\n",
    "  - Class notes are provided on the course website, which includes web urls (for jargon) and video explanations of some topics.\n",
    "- GitHub accounts\n",
    "  - GitHub is a convenient way to store and share information.\n",
    "  - Create GitHub account and fork repository.\n"
