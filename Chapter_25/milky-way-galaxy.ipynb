    "Humans have peered into the heavens and contemplated its vastness.  Sometimes, we have proposed various models to explain its form.  In some civilizations, the stars were believed to be on a celestial sphere that rotated majestically above a fixed, central Earth (i.e., geocentrism of Ptolemy).  When Galileo made his first telescopic observations, we started down a long road that has dramatically expanded our view of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "it is possible to get at least a general idea about the nature of other galaxies by studying our own Galaxy, but this is very challenging.  We live in a disk of stars, dust, and gas that severely impacts our ability to \"see\" beyond our relative stellar neighborhood when we look along the plane of the disk.  The problem is most severe when looking toward the center of the Galaxy in the constellation Sagittarius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of what we know today about the formation and evolution of the Milky Way is encoded in the motions of the Galaxy's constituents, especially when combined with information about the variations in composition.  Unfortunately, measuring the motions of the stars and gas in the Galaxy is done from a moving observing platform (i.e., the Earth) that is undergoing another motion around the Sun, which is orbiting the Galactic center.\n",

    "From observations of a *dark* night sky, an almost continuous band of light appears to circle the Earth.  It is inclined by about $60^\\circ$ with respect to the celestial equator.  It was Galileo who first realized that this Milky Way is a vast collection of individual stars.  In the mid-1700s, Kant and Wright proposed that the Galaxy must be a stellar disk and our Solar System is merely one component within that disk.  In the 1780s, William Herschel produced a map of the Milky Way based crudely on counting the number of stars the he could observe in 683 regions of the sky.  In his analysis, Herschel assumed that\n",

    "- all stars have approximately the same *absolute* magnitude,\n",
    "- the number density of stars in space is roughly constant,\n",
    "- there is nothing between the stars to obscure them, and \n",
    "- he could see the *edges* of the stellar distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "From his data, Herschel concluded that the Sun had to be very near the center of the distribution and that the dimensions measured along the plane of the disk were some $5\\times$ greater than the disk's vertical thickness.\n",

Through the use of more quantitative methods, Kapteyn was able specify a distance scale for his model of the Galaxy.  The **Kapteyn universe** was a flattened spheroidal system with a steadily decreasing stellar density with increasing distance from the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the plane of the Galaxy and at a distance of some $800\\ \\rm pc$ from the center, the number density of stars had decreased from its central value by a factor of $2$.  On an axis passing through thecenter and perpendicular to the central plane, the number density decreased by $50\\%$ over a distance of only $150\\ \\rm pc$.  The number density diminished to $1\\%$ of its central value at distances of $8500\\ \\rm pc$ (in the plane) and $1700\\ \\rm pc$ (perpendicular to the plane).

    "\n",
    "Assuming a value for $M$ (e.g., if the spectral class and luminosity class are known) and measuring $m$ at a telescope, the distance modulus $m-M$ and the distance $d$ are readily obtained.  Given the known coordinates of the star on the celestial sphere, its 3D position relative to the Earth is determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In actuality, it is impractical to estimate the distance to each individual star in the way described above because the number of stars in any given region is so great.  Instead, a statistical approach is used that is based on counting the number of stars in specified region down to a predetermined limiting apparent magnitude.  From this counting procedure, the number density of stars at a given distance can be estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly before Kapteyn's model was published, Harlow Shapley estimated the distances to 93 globular clusters using [RR Lyrae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RR_Lyrae_variable) and [W Virginis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_Virginis) stars.  These stars are easily identified in the clusters through their periodic variations in luminosity, and it is a matter of using the period-luminosity relation (to get their absolute magnitudes) to estimate their distances from the Sun.  The distances to the variable stars correspond to the distances to the clusters in which they reside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapley recognized that the globular clusters are not distributed uniformly throughout space, but are found preferentially in a region of the sky that is centered in the constellation of Sagittarius, at $15\\ \\rm kpc$ from the Sun.  He estimated that the most distant clusters are more than $70 \\rm kpc$ form the Sun, over $55\\ \\rm kpc$ from the center.  As a result, Shapley believed that the diameter of the Galaxy was on the order of $100 \\rm kpc$, which is close to $10 \\times$ the diameter estimated by Kapteyn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we known that Kapteyn's universe was too small and the Sun was too near the center, and Shapley's Galactic model was too large.  Both models errored in part for the same reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the failure to include in their distance estimates the effects of interstellar extinction due to gas and dust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kapteyn's selected regions were largely within the Galactic disk where extinction effects are most severe; as a result, he was unable to see the most distant portions of the Milky Way (causing him to underestimate its size).  The problem is analogous to someone on Earth trying to see the surrounding land while standing in a dense fog with limited visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapely chose to study objects that are generally found well above (and below) the plane of the Milky Way, and are inherently bright, which makes them visible from great distances.  It is in directions perpendicular to the disk that interstellar extinction is least important, although it cannot be neglected entirely.  Errors in the calibration of the period-luminosity relation used by Shapely let to overestimates of the distances to the clusters.  The calibration errors were traced to the effects of interstellar extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kapteyn was aware of the errors that interstellar extinction could introduce but he was unable to find any quantitative evidence for the effect.  Other researchers at the time suspected that dust might be responsible for the dark bands running across the Milky Way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Further evidence for strong extinction could also be found in Shapely's own data.  No globular clusters were visible within a region between approximately $\\pm 10^\\circ$ of the Galactic plane called the **zone of avoidance**.  Shapely suggested that globular clusters were apparently absent in the zone of avoidance because strong gravitational tidal forces disrupted the objects in that region; this was a similar argument for the existence of the Asteroid Belt in the Solar System.  In reality, interstellar extinction is so severe within the zone of avoidance that the very bright clusters are simply undetectable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Effects of Interstellar Extinction\n",
    "To see how interstellar extinction directly affects the estimates of stellar distances, we find\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d^\\prime = 10^{(m_\\lambda - M_\\lambda + 5)/5}$ is the erroneous estimate of the distance when extinction is neglected, and $A_\\lambda$ is the amount of extinction in magnitudes.  The extinction coefficient and magnitudes ($M$ and $m$) are all a function of wavelength due to the wavelength dependent way that light is scattered (or blocked) by dust or absorbed by gas clouds.  Since $A_\\lambda \\geq 0$ in all cases (i.e., extinction can't make a star appear brighter), $d\\leq d^\\prime$; the true distance is always less than the apparent distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the disk of the Milky Way, the typical extinction rate in visible wavelengths is $1\\ \\rm mag/kpc$.  The value can vary dramatically if the line of sight includes distinct nebulae (e.g., molecular clouds).  Fortunately, it is often possible to estimate the amount of extinction by considering how dust affect the color of a star (i.e., interstellar reddening).\n",

Rather, the number of stars visible in selected regions of the sky are counted over a specified apparent magnitude range.  Alternatively, all stars in the regions brighter than a chose limit of apparent magnitude can be counted.  These approaches are known as **differential** and **integrated star counts**, respectively.\n",

    "The important parameter of composition is quantified by the *ratio* of iron to hydrogen and has become almost universally adopted because iron lines are generally identifiable in stellar spectra.  During a supernova detonation (particularly of Type Ia), iron is ejected, which enriches the ISM.  New stars can then be created with a greater abundance of iron in their atmospheres relative to their predecessors.\n",

    "\n",
    "Stars with abundances identical to the Sun have $[{\\rm Fe}/{\\rm H}] = 0.0$, where less metal-rich stars have negative values, and more metal-rich stars have positive values.  Measurements of our Galaxy have found values ranging from $-5.4$ for *old, metal-poor** stars to $0.6$ for *young, metal-rich* stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to studies of the main-sequence turnoff points in clusters, metal-rich stars tend to be younger than metal-poor stars of a similar spectral type.  The apparent correlation between age and composition is called the [age-metallicity relation](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March03/McWilliam/McWilliam5.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "in many situations, the correlation between the age and $[{\\rm Fe}/{\\rm H}]$ may not be as reliable.  For example, significant numbers of Type Ia supernovae do not appear until ${\\sim}10^9\\ \\rm yr$ after star formation begins.

In other words, a local region of the ISM may become iron-enriched after $10^9\\ \\rm yr$, while another region may not experience the same level of enrichment.  According to the age-metallicity relation, the iron-rich regin would subsequently produce stars that appear younger, when in fact both regions are the same age.\n",

    "According to various age determinations, the stellar members of the thin disk are probably significantly younger than their thick-disk counterparts.  It appears that star formation began in the thin disk about $8\\ \\rm Gyr$ ago and is ongoing today.  This conclusion is supported by the observations of white-dwarf stars in the thin disk and theoretical estimates of their cooling times.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also evidence that star formation in the thin disk may not have been continuous over time, but actually come in bursts with intervening gaps of several billion years.  On the other hand, star formation in the thick disk appears to have predated the onset of star formation in the thin disk by $2-3\\ \\rm Gyr$.  It is generally believed that the episode of thick-disk star formation spanned the time interval between $10-11\\ \\rm Gyr$ ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mass-to-Light Ratios\n",
    "From star counts and orbital motions, te estimated stellar mass of the thin disk is roughly $6\\times 10^{10}\\ M_\\odot$ with another $0.5 \\times 10^{10}\\ M_\\odot$ of gas and dust.  The luminosity in the blue is $L_B = 1.8 \\times 10^{10}\\ L_\\odot$.  When the first of these parameters is divided by the second, the result is the **mass-to-light ratio**, which is $M/L_B \\approx 3 M_\\odot/L_\\odot$.  This quantity gives us information about the kinds of stars responsible for the generation of the light.\n",

Apparently the total luminosity of the disk is dominated by stars somewhat less massive than the Sun.  This should not be surprising since the initial mass function (IMF) indicates that many more low-mass than high-mass stars are created out of the interstellar medium.  This is also consistent with M-dwarf stars being the most common class of stars in the Sun's vicinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $B$-band luminosity of the thick disk is $2\\times 10^8\\ \\rm L_\\odot$, or $1\\%$ of the thin disk's luminosity.  This explains why the thick disk is so difficult to detect.

At a distance of only $24\\ \\rm kpc$ from Earth and $16\\ \\rm kpc$ from the center of the Milky Way, the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal is the closest galaxy to Earth.  It is elongated with the long axis directed toward the Galactic center and has underwent only a few orbital encounters (with a radial velocity of $140\\ \\rm km/s$) with the Milky Way.

The bulge is not simply an extension of the disk but is an independent component of the Galaxy.  The mass of the bulge is roughly $10^{10}\\ M_\\odot$ and its $B$-band luminosity is near $3\\times 10^9\\ L_\\odot$.

At the infrared wavelength of $12\\ \\rm \\mu m$, star count data from the [InfraRed Astronomical Satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRAS) (IRAS) suggests an effective radius of ${\\sim}0.7\\ \\rm kpc$.  Similar results were found by COBE.\n",
    "\n",
    "A serious difficulty in observing the properties of the bulge rests in the large amount of extinction at visible wavelengths due to the dust between the Sun and the Galactic center.

    "Although 144 of the globular clusters are found within $42\\ \\rm kpc$ of the Galactic center, 6 globular clusters have been found between $69-123\\ \\rm kpc$ of the Galactic center.  Some astronomers have suggested that those six most distant clusters may have been captured by the Milky Way or may be dwarf spheroidal galaxies, much as $\\omega$ Cen and the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy may have been.  If we do not include these very remote objects, the metal-poor clusters seem to be confined to a halo with a radius of ${\\sim}42\\ \\rm kpc$.  The detection of extremely distant and luminous field stars suggests that a stellar halo radius of $50\\ \\rm kpc$ could be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number density profile of the metal-poor globular clusters and the field stars has the form\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "n_{\\rm halo}(r) = n_{o,\\rm halo}(r/a)^{-3.5},\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_{o,\\rm halo} \\simeq 4 \\times 10^{-5}\\ {\\rm pc^{-3}}$ is roughly $0.2\\%$ of the thin disk's midplane.  The scale length $a$ of the number density distribution is several thousand parsecs.  At visible wavelengths, the effective radius of the halo $r^{1/4}$ law is $r_e = 2.7\\ \\rm kpc$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dark Matter Halo\n",
    "When the masses of all the luminous components of the Galaxy are combined (e.g.,  thin and thick disks, ISM, Galactic bulge, stellar halo, and the bar), the total mass of luminous matter in the Galaxy is estimated to be $9 \\times 10^{10}\\ M_\\odot$.  There is another crucial component to the overall structure of our Galaxy.  There may also be an unseen element that is responsible for the generation of the warps in the H I distribution near the outer edges of the luminous disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **dark matter halo** seems to be roughly spherically distributed, enveloping the stellar halo and extending out to ${\\sim}230\\ \\rm kpc$.  The dark matter halo has an apparent mass distribution of the form,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\rho(r) = \\frac{\\rho_o}{\\left( r/a\\right) \\left(1+r/a \\right)^2},\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho_o$ and $a$ are fitted coefficients using the mass distribution in the dark matter halo.\n",
    "\n",
    "This functional dependence behaves as $1/r$ when $r\\ll a$ and as $1/r^3$ when $r\\gg a$.  The mass of the dark matter halo can be $5.4 \\times 10^{11}\\ M_\\odot$ and $1.9 \\times 10^{12}\\ M_\\odot$ within $50\\ \\rm kpc$ or $230\\ \\rm kpc$ of the Galactic center, respectively.  It appears that the dark matter halo accounts for about $95\\%$ of the entire mass of the Galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The composition of the dark matter halo is still under investigation.  Some sources of mass have been excluded, where it cannot be interstellar dust because the dust block starlight and allow us to detect its presence.  The dark matter halo cannot be composed of gas, because absorption lines would be apparent when observing halo stars.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One possible set of candidates are [**weakly interacting massive particles**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particle) (WIMPs).  The WIMPs would not contribute to the overall luminosity of the Galaxy, but they would affect it through their gravitational interactions.  In support of a WIMP-dominated Galaxy, theoretical calculations of the formation and evolution of the universe suggest that non-baryonic matter (i.e., constituents of matter that are not protons, neutrons and related massive particles) may constitute the majority of the mass for the dark matter halo.\n",
    "\n",
    "A competing hypothesis suggests that [**massive compact halo objects**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_compact_halo_object) (MACHOs) may be responsible.  MACHOs that could supply the unseen mass could be white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, or less exotic red or brown dwarfs.  Some searches for MACHOs are based on the general relativistic prediction that starlight is deflected as it passes near a massive object.  If a MACHO is located between a distant star and Earth, the light from the star can be focused with the MACHO acting as a [gravitational lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens).\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Galactic Magnetic Field\n",
    "The Galaxy possess a magnetic field.  The orientation and strength of the field can be measured using the Zeeman effect and the polarization of visible- and radio-wavelength electromagnetic radiation by reflection from interstellar grains aligned with the field.  It appears that within the disk , the field tends to follow the Galaxy's spiral arms and has a typical strength of $0.4\\ \\rm nT$.  The field strength near the Galactic center may reach $1\\ \\micro T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global Galactic magnetic field is quite weak relative the Earth's magnetic field near the surface (${\\sim}50\\ \\mu T$), but it likely plays a role in the structure and evolution of the Milky Way.  The energy density within the Galaxy appears to be comparable to the thermal energy density of gas within the disk."
